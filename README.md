# Adventures-of-Sticklandia
A Medieval Choose Your Own Adventure Visual Novel

I enjoyed the opportunity to try something new and the creative outlet that this game gave me.
I, at first, had challenges adjusting to ren'py's coding language, primarily figuring out how to incorporate python code.
Thankfully, Ren'Py has plenty of learning tools on their website. I could look elsewhere on the internet for anything else I needed to know.
I eventually found out that "python:" lets you write regular python code without causing errors.

I learned how to change the background for the game and some of the main menu options.

Creating the art was a struggle. The stick figure art style idea came from the fact that I couldn't find everything I would need online.
I had to use two apps on different devices because one of them had a dimensions limit of 800x800 or else it had a watermark.
I was able to use that one for the characters, but had to use a different one for backgrounds.

My own ambition was an obstacle. Even with less than three hours until submission, I was trying to add new endings.
I would have loved to do more, but I'm satisfied with what I did get done.

The last challenge was file uploading. I had to compress the game files so that GitHub would accept it.
I also wanted to include playable versions of the game, but only the Mac version was small enough for GitHub to accept it.

Speaking of files:
- Zack Peters_Freshman_Adventures of Sticklandia is my walkthrough video.
- Adventures of Sticklandia.zip is the game files, which includes all of the code. It can only run through Ren'Py
- script.py is the script of the game, which is where most of my work in the files was done.
  I included it separately to make it easier to find.
- AdventuresofSticklandia-1.0-mac.zip is a downloadable version of the game for Mac, which doesn't need Ren'Py to run.
